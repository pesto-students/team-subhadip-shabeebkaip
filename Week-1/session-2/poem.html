  <p>
    I'm nobody! Who are you?<br>
    Are you - nobody - Too?<br>
    Then there's a pair of us <br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
    How public - like a Frog -<br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
    To an admiring Bog!<br>
