### Protocol Stack

A protocol stack refers to a set of network protocols that are layered on top of each other to enable communication between different components in a web application or between a client and a server over the internet.
The most commonly used protocol stack in web development is the TCP/IP protocol stack, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It consists of multiple layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of communication.Here's a brief overview of the layers in the TCP/IP protocol stack
- Application Layer: 
This layer includes protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and others. The application layer protocols define how data is formatted and exchanged between web browsers (clients) and web servers.
- Transport Layer: 
The transport layer is responsible for ensuring reliable and error-free delivery of data between two endpoints. The most commonly used transport protocol in web development is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- Internet Layer: 
The internet layer handles the addressing and routing of data packets across different networks. The IP (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol used at this layer, which assigns unique IP addresses to devices and enables them to communicate with each other.
- Network Interface Layer: 
 This layer deals with the physical transmission of data packets over a network medium, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or other types of network connections.

In web development, the protocol stack is utilized to establish communication between a client (e.g., web browser) and a server. When a user requests a web page, the client and server interact through various layers of the protocol stack to exchange data.

For example, when a user enters a URL in their web browser and presses Enter, the browser initiates an HTTP request at the application layer. The request is then encapsulated into TCP segments at the transport layer, which are further encapsulated into IP packets at the internet layer. These packets are then transmitted through the network interface layer to the destination server. On the server side, the process is reversed, with each layer extracting and processing the relevant information until the requested web page is delivered back to the client.
